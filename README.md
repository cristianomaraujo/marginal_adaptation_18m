# Non-Carious Cervical Lesion Marginal Adaptation Failure Prediction Model
## Introduction
This repository contains a supervised machine learning model aimed at predicting the possible risk of marginal adaptation failure in non-carious cervical lesion (NCCL) restorations. The model focuses on identifying potential failures within the first 18 months post-treatment.

## Objective
The primary objective of this predictive model is to anticipate the risk of marginal adaptation failure, even at an early stage, in NCCL restorations. By leveraging supervised machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide valuable insights for clinicians to improve post-treatment monitoring and enhance patient care.

## Dataset
The model utilizes a dataset consisting of clinical data related to NCCL restorations, including patient demographics, characteristics of the dental structure, and details of the adhesive systems used. The dataset has been carefully curated and processed to ensure the quality and reliability of the predictive model.
